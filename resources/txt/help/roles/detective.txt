=Help: Detective=

*Alignment:* Village.
*Ability:* Investigate.
*To win:* Survive.

*Description:* The Detective is aligned to the village. Once each night, the Detective can investigate a player. At the end of the night, the Detective is told whether or not that player was behaving suspiciously during the night. In general, a player behaving suspiciously is likely to be harmful to the village.

*Notes:*
- Although useful, the Detective's ability is not perfect. Some roles are harmless to the village and appear suspicious, whilst others are dangerous and appear innocent.
- Furthermore, the Dealer is able to make one other player of his or her choice appear suspicious each night.
