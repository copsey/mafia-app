# Mafia

An app for running games of [Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)).

## Features
- One person needs to run the game, everybody else gets to be a player.
- Support for 11 different roles and as many players as you like.
- You enter text into a console to set up a new game, voting for who gets lynched, choosing who the detective will investigate, etc. If you're ever stuck on what to do, just enter "help".
- Automatically plays music from iTunes if you create a playlist named "Mafia" and add a few tracks. (I recommend adding [the soundtrack from the Godfather franchise.](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-godfather-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1440486196))
