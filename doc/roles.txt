Actor

Alignment: Freelance.
Abilities: None.
To win: Survive.

Description: The Actor is a freelance role, whose goal is simply to survive to the end of the game. However, there's an awkward catch. At the beginning of the game, the Actor will be shown an additional "pretend" role - they must pretend that this is their actual role for the remainder of the game. This covers every aspect of the role, including alignment, abilities, whether or not it appears as suspicious, etc. As always, any form of cheating should result in the game host kicking the Actor from the game at the next possible opportunity.

Notes:
- It would be a good idea for the Actor to read the rulebook entry for their pretend role once they know what it is.
- It is difficult to say exactly what constitutes as cheating, other than that the Actor should claim details of their pretend role to the best of their knowledge. Ultimately, it is up to the game host to decide whether or not the Actor is cheating.
- The Actor does not gain any additional abilities or traits from their pretend role. In particular, they appear as innocent when investigated.
- Once a player's role changes from the Actor to something else, they are no longer obliged to claim that they have any particular role.




Apothecary

Alignment: Village.
Abilities: Heal(2/3) x 2
To win: Survive.

Description: The Apothecary is aligned to the village. Each night, the Apothecary can target up to 2 other players to heal. These heal abilities independently have a 2/3 chance of success, and a 1/3 chance of having no effect. Upon successfully healing a player, that player cannot be killed from the vast majority of sources. Furthermore, the diseases that currently afflict them are cured.

Notes:
- The Apothecary cannot heal themself.
- Even when successful, healing a player does not fully guarantee that they will survive the night. (for instance, they could still die from the Mercenary's ability or by committing suicide.)
- The Apothecary cannot use both of their heals on the same player.
- The Apothecary is not told whether or not their heals were successful.
- The Apothecary's heals are independently blocked if used on a player that has successfully used a kill ability on the Apothecary during the night.
- The Apothecary cannot become infected by using a heal on another player, although they can still be infected by other players visiting them, even if the player who visits them is the player that they are healing.




Coward

Alignment: Freelance.
Abilities: None.
To win: Survive.

Description: The Coward is a freelance role, whose goal is simply to survive to the end of the game. However, the Coward has the disadvantage of appearing suspicious when investigated.




Dealer

Alignment: Mafia.
Ability: Peddle.
To win: Survive.

Description: The Dealer is part of the Mafia. Once each night, the Dealer can target a player, forcing that player to appear as suspicious if investigated during the night.

Notes:
- The Dealer's ability has no effect on roles which already appear as suspicious.
- The effect of the Dealer's ability wears off at the end of the night.




Detective

Alignment: Village.
Ability: Investigate.
To win: Survive.

Description: The Detective is aligned to the village. Once each night, the Detective can investigate a player. At the end of the night, the Detective is told whether or not that player was behaving suspiciously. In general, a player behaving suspiciously is likely to be harmful to the village.

Notes:
- Although useful, the Detective's ability is not perfect. Some roles are harmless to the village and appear suspicious, whilst others are dangerous and appear innocent. Further, the Dealer is able to make anybody they choose appear suspicious for the night.




Doctor

Alignment: Village.
Ability: Heal.
To win: Survive.

Description: The Doctor is aligned to the village. Once each night, the Doctor can target another player to heal. In the vast majority of cases, a player who has been healed cannot be killed during the night. Furthermore, when a player is healed, the diseases that currently afflict them are cured.

Notes:
- The Doctor cannot heal themself.
- Healing a player does not fully guarantee that they will survive the night. (for instance, they could still die from the Mercenary's ability or by committing suicide.)
- The Doctor's heal is automatically blocked if it is used on a player that has successfully used a kill ability on the Doctor during the night.
- The Doctor cannot become infected by using their heal ability on another player, although they can still be infected by other players visiting them, even if the player who visits them is the player that they are healing.




Framer

Alignment: Mafia.
Ability: Cover-up.
To win: Survive.

Description: The Framer is part of the Mafia. Once each night, the Framer can target a player as the victim of a cover-up. If the Mafia successfully manage to kill their target that night, then an additional headline is added to the following day's news, claiming that the Framer's target was responsible for the murder.

Notes:
- A headline generated by the Framer includes both the name of the Framer's target and the name of the player who was killed.
- If a headline is generated by the Framer, then no other headlines are written blaming a player for the death of the Mafia's target. (however, a headline could be written which reveals that a member of the Mafia attempted to kill somebody, where the target of the kill is left anonymous.)
- The Framer's ability does not generate an additional headline if the Mafia's target survived the night.
- In the event that multiple Framers target the same player, only one headline is generated. In the event that multiple Framers target different players, none of the Framers' abilities succeed, and each Framer is told that their ability was blocked.
- The Mafia do not directly have to be responsible for their target's death for the Framer's ability to succeed. So long as the player targeted by the Mafia died during the night, a headline will be created by the Framer as described above. (for instance, the Framer's ability succeeds if the Mafia's target was healed, but also committed suicide.)




Journalist

Alignment: Village.
Ability: Write news.
To win: Survive.

Description: The Journalist is aligned to the village. At the end of each night, the Journalist automatically writes an extra headline for the following day's news. The Journalist has no control over the contents of this headline, although it is guaranteed to be true. Importantly, if there are multiple headlines, the Journalist has no way of knowing which headline was written by themself.

Notes:
- Whilst the headline written by the Journalist is always true, it is entirely possible that there could be additional headlines in the news that are false.
- The Journalist's ability is passive, but can still be blocked.
- An extra headline is written by the Journalist on any night where they are alive at its beginning, even if they are killed during the night.
- Each Journalist writes their own additional headline; in other words, the abilities of multiple Journalists stack.




Mad Scientist

Alignment: Freelance.
Ability: Infect.
To win: Be the last survivor.

Description: The Mad Scientist is a freelance role, whose goal is to be the last player left alive. Once each night, the Mad Scientist can choose to infect another player with a deadly disease. During the following night, anyone whom that player visits and anyone who visits that player also becomes infected. (excluding the Mad Scientist, who is immune.) At the end of this following night, the infected player dies.

It is not possible to cure somebody of a disease on the night that they were infected. However, on the following night, any infected player who has been healed is cured of their infection.

The Mad Scientist appears as suspicious when investigated.

Notes:
- The game cannot end until either the Mad Scientist has been eliminated, or all of the other players have been eliminated.
- The Mad Scientist only has immunity from their own disease, and can still become infected with the diseases of other Mad Scientists.
- Apart from the Mad Scientist, nobody can gain immunity from the Mad Scientist's disease.
- Diseases are spread between players before players are healed. For this reason, it is possible for a player to spread their disease to another player and become cured of it themself in a single night.
- Whilst it is possible for healing roles (such as the Doctor) to become infected with a disease, they do not catch a disease by visiting an infected player for the purpose of healing.




Mercenary

Alignment: Mafia.
Ability: Single-use guaranteed kill.
To win: Survive.

Description: The Mercenary is part of the Mafia. During any night in which the Mercenary performs the Mafia's kill, the Mercenary can activate an extra ability that guarantees the death of their target. However, this ability can only be activated once in the entire game.

The Mercenary also has a kill strength of 20, which is higher than any other role in the Mafia.

Notes:
- The Mercenary's guaranteed kill can fail to apply in some situations. (for example, by being blocked.) In this case, the Mercenary's ability is not used up.
- A kill strength of 20 puts the Mercenary level with the Vigilante, but below the Serial Killer.
- The Mercenary's guaranteed kill succeeds even when used against a player with a higher kill strength who attempts to kill the Mercenary. In such a situation, the Mercenary would also be killed.




Musketeer

Alignment: Freelance.
Ability: Duel.
To win: Defeat someone in a duel.

Description: The Musketeer is a freelance role, whose goal is to win a duel. At any point during the day, the Musketeer can challenge another player to a duel. The loser of the duel is killed. If the Musketeer wins the duel, they instantly leave the game. Regardless of the result, the Musketeer can therefore only participate in a single duel.

The winner of a duel is randomly chosen, although the role against which the Musketeer duels has a significant impact on how likely the Musketeer is to win. In general, the Musketeer is more likely to win against "timid" roles (such as the Doctor and the Coward) and less likely to win against "harmful" roles (such as the Serial Killer and the Vigilante).

Notes:
- The game can end before the Musketeer has been involved in a duel, in which case the Musketeer loses.
- The Musketeer challenging another player to a duel is treated the same as another player challenging the Musketeer to a duel. In other words, the Musketeer will still achieve their goal if the duel they win was initiated by somebody else.




Peasant

Alignment: Village.
Abilities: None.
To win: Survive.

Description: The Peasant is the most basic of the village roles. The Peasant has no traits of particular interest, nor any abilities to use. On the plus side, this does tend to make the Peasant a low-priority target for the Mafia and other hostile roles.




Racketeer

Alignment: Mafia.
Abilities: None.
To win: Survive.

Description: The Racketeer is part of the Mafia. The Racketeer has a kill strength of 15, which is slightly stronger than most of the other roles in the Mafia. Apart from this, the Racketeer has no traits of particular interest, nor any abilities to use.

Note:
- A kill strength of 15 puts the Racketeer behind all other killing roles, but above the default kill strength.




Serial Killer

Alignment: Freelance.
Ability: Kill.
To win: Be the last survivor.

Description: The Serial Killer is a freelance role, whose goal is to be the last player left alive. Once each night, the Serial Killer can target another player to kill. The Serial Killer appears as suspicious when investigated.

Notes:
- The game cannot end until either the Serial Killer has been eliminated, or all of the other players have been eliminated.
- The Serial Killer has a kill strength of 1000, making them the strongest killer in the game.




Vigilante

Alignment: Village.
Ability: Single-use kill.
To win: Survive.

Description: The Vigilante is aligned to the village. During the night, the Vigilante may target another player to kill. However, this ability can only be used once in the entire game.

Notes:
- The kill ability is not used up if the Vigilante was blocked during the night.
- The kill ability could still be used up even if the targeted player survives, e.g. if they were healed during the night.
- The Vigilante has a kill strength of 20, putting them above most roles in the Mafia but below the Serial Killer.




Village Idiot

Alignment: Freelance.
Abilities: None.
To win: Be lynched.

Description: The Village Idiot is a freelance role, whose goal is to be killed in a lynch. As such, the Village Idiot has an opposite agenda to many roles, in that they want to appear as suspicious as possible to the other players. (to be clear, the Village Idiot appears as innocent when investigated.)

The fact that a daily lynch has been wasted is not the only reason to avoid voting against the Village Idiot. In addition, at the end of the following night, one of the players who voted against the Village Idiot commits suicide. This player is chosen at random, out of those players that also survived to the end of the night.

Notes:
- The game can end at any point whilst the Village Idiot is alive.
- A player who has committed suicide cannot be saved in any way. (for instance, their death is not prevented through the effects of healing.)
- If none of the players that voted against the Village Idiot survive to the end of the night, then no suicide takes place.
